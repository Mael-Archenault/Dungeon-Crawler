In this document, I will review all features that were added to the dungeon crawler.

CONTEXT : I created the base of the project choosing the "Super Sayian" path. In the aftermath, some parts of the
    code are a bit different with what was on the Github of Mr. Tauvel.

ADDED FEATURES :
    - by pressing two directions keys, the player is able to move diagonally, without even getting a speed
      boost (general speed is conserved but diagonally).

    - debugging tool : pressing H will show the hitbox of every SolidSprite. Press again to make them disappear

    - I added the possibility to change hitbox position relative to the top-left corner of the image : that way,
        the hitbox is not locked with the sprite.

    - by pressing space, the hero sets a bomb which explode after a certain amount of time. The explosion will
          remove life points to each figure in the bomb field. Moreover, if a bomb explodes, it will trigger other
          bombs that are in the field and make them explode instantaneously. The hitbox of the bomb really fit the
           deflagration (press H).
           To fix : when a bomb is exploding, if we place another bomb in the hitbox, the game crashes.

    -added enemy patterns. The enemy has a list of point it had to visit. At each point, it settles for a short
        moment, then go to the next point. The bot should be able to avoid solid obstacles.
        To fix: when the obstacle is exactly aligned with the target point, the bot get stuck by going again on
                his steps.
                When the hero comes to the bot and sticks to it, there is sometimes everything that crashes.
